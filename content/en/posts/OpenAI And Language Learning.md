# OpenAI And Language Learning

## Introduction

This short article describes how I made a python script based on the OpenAI examples (linkneeded) and the european language levels Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions
At the end of the article I present the prototype python code'

## Motivation
One of the things I've found fustrating while learning a language on my own is the difficulty of finding reading material that is 
 * on my level 
 * interesting to me.

While playing with the aforementioned OpenAI python examples it occured to me that I could try to to use the european language levels (A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2) to generate texts in foreign languages at those levels.

Several attempts later. I had a prototype script and prompt that seemed to work reasonably well. I added a bunch of commandline options an defaults and got something halfway decent.

You can give this script the following arguments:
```
-s or --subject eq. -s "History of Florence" Or -s "History" -s "Florence"
-l or --length number of words eq. 500 (default 500)
-L or --language eq. -L italian (default "Italian")
-a or --level  eq -a A1/A2/B1/B2/C1/C2 (default "B1")
-S or --style eq -S formal/informal/cynical etc etc (default="formal")
-f or --format eq -f article/blog/.. (default="article")
-t or --tone Tone of text to generate. neutral, light, somber, humorous, sarcastic etc (default="neutral")

```

I now use this script to generate daily pieces of text in italian an latin to read during my commute to and from work. 

I run it under termux (link needed) on my Android telephone. 

## Results

This script ticks all the following boxes for me.
 * Interesting text to read? Check
 * In a language I'm learning? Check
 * On a level I can manage? Check
 * Usable on a phone? Check
 * During an otherwise boring an nonproductive time? Check


# Running the code

## OpenAI account
To use this with OpenAI, I recommend you get a "pay as you go" account. It is the cheapest way to use OpenAI for personal use. Don't forget to lower the monthly limit from 120 dollars to say 5 dollars. That way you limit the damage from possible runaway programs.

## Setup
Generate an openAI api key and store it in the file .env in the same directory as the python file. 
```
OPEN_AI_KEY="youopenaikeyhere"
```
If you use git, don't forget to add the .env file to the .gitignore file.

## Caveats
When set to the C2 level the results can be rather ..ahem.. poetic!

When generating a piece of text in a language like latin about a modern subject, the result can be anything from hilarious to absurd.
(I haven't dared to try Klingon yet)

## Examples

### A1 language level

./run.py -s "Amsterdam History" -L English -a A1

```
**Amsterdam History**

Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands. It has a very interesting history. The cityâ€™s history begins in the 12th century. At this time, Amsterdam was a small fishing village. The people in the village lived by the water. They caught fish and traded them with other places. The name "Amsterdam" comes from a dam on the river Amstel. This dam was built to protect the village from the water.
```
Note the short simple sentences.

### C2 language level

./run.py -s "Amsterdam History" -L English -a C2

```
Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands, boasts a rich and multi-faceted history that dates back to its founding in the late 12th century. Originally established as a modest fishing village along the banks of the Amstel River, the city's name is derived from the word "Amstelredamme," which signifies a dam constructed on the river. This early settlement laid the groundwork for what would become a significant urban center in Europe.
```

Note the longer more complex sentences and extended vocabulary
