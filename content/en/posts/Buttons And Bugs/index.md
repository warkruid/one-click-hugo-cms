I managed to setup ![hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and git under ![Termux](https://znotes.thedoc.eu.org/) on my phone. Using ![zettelnotes](https://znotes.thedoc.eu.org/) I can now make pages for my mini blog. Yay! 

As a first try I will attach a photo from my phone. It shows my attempt to paint the character tokens from !["Buttons And Bugs"](https://cephalofair.com/pages/buttons-bugs)
