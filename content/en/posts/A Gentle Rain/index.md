I've been playing "A Gentle Rain" for some time now. Reached a score of 15 this morning.

This is a solo tile laying game. It is simple, and the only goal you have is to get a high as possible score. (The maximum theoretically possible is 21)

I find it a nice, soothing distraction if I have a couple of minutes to spare.
