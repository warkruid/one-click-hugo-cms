I am feeling my way slowly into this whole blogging thing. 

One of the aspects of blogging is the use of good graphics.
As you can't just copy things from the internet and use them for your own, (copyright, plagiarism and all that), I turned to Unsplash. Only to find that Unsplash had been bought by Getty Images somewhere in 2021.

So I feared the worst. I searched on unsplash on duckduckgo and did not find a link to unsplash.. What?  After manually typing unsplash.com in the browser I got where I wanted to be.

And yes.. the selection of images that I got when I searched unsplash was significantly less in quality than I remembered before. And _of course_ it had a prominent reference to "premium" fotos on Istock.

Bummer!

Some searching on "unsplash" revealed other disturbing information on the license under which the photos could be used.
Since 2017 not compatible with Creative Commons and so not usable with Wikipedia? 

Oh! I am really behind the times... :-(

Hard pass!

So I have to make my own graphics and photos. A bit of a challenge, but not impossible.

PS. Maybe all this above is why when I searched on unsplash I could not find the unsplash site on duckduckgo. It dropped from duckduckgo's search rankings. Under google, the first search result on "unsplash" was "https://unsplash.com". Mmmm....
