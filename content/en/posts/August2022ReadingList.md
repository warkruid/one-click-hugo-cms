# Reading list Augustus 2022
* Simple Guide To Shinto. Ian Reader. 1998 (Reread) History, Religion
A concise description of the Shinto Religion. I would not describe it as "simple".
I particularly liked the description of various festivals and legends.
The descriptions of the interaction between shinto and politics helped me to place 
certain aspects of WWII in context.

* The Crucible of Islam. G.W. Bowersock. 2017 History, Religion, Muslim, Medieval
I stumbled on this book in my readings on Byzantium. Reading it made me realize how
much of a "black swan" event the rise of islam was. 
And also how "intermingled" the events in christianity,judaism, and paganism were in the period ca 632 to 661.
The book describes the problems with the historical sources from that period. The muslim sources are practically
non existant until about two centuries after this period.
