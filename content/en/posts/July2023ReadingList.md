# Readinglist July
* Slimmer studeren. Iris & Felicitas Komarek
Gives a good set of tips and techniques about smarter studying
translated from german "lernen fuer faule" 2017 into dutch.

* How to solve it. G. Polya. 
This book describes heuristics for solving mathematical problems.
I still lack to much background in math. Will return to this book at a later time

* How to be a stoic. Penguin books - Great ideas.
A reader with excerpts from Epictetus's "Enchiridon", Seneca's "On the shortness of life", Marcus Aurelius's "The meditations"
I'll admit I did not have a clear idea of what a stoic precisely was. I thought it was someone who endured misfortune without complaints. This collection of texts gave me a more nuanced view on stoicism. "Welcome events in whichever way they happen". Good Or Bad, accept it and don't let either disturb you too much.
