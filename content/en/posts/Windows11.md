Windows 11 pros and cons

After working a few months with windows 11, it is sometimes hard to stay objective when things are not functioning as you were accustomed to. Expecially when having to switch between windows 10 and 11.

So I am trying to list the good and the bad things I notice about windows 11 here, over a period of time.

(I am trying to say good things about windows 11.. Really!)

GOOD
* Stability.. No more hangs on surface tablets
*


BAD
* Windows 11 tries to force users into an online login and subcription model.
* Non microsoft programs are harder to install. Microsoft tries to force their online store on users
* More spyware... ahem... unnessecary services that are harder and harder to uninstall.. Especially services that try to install Microsoft office programs.
