Welcome to Warkruid's Weeds


# Disclaimer

This is a blog about things I am learning about. It will contain notes about things I am reading.
Code snippets that I am thinkering with. And sometimes "Off the wall" ideas.

As such, any information on this blog is very much "As Is" and could be wrong. Use with caution!

It is a learning tool (and record) for me, and I hope that over time the quality of writing
and information will improve. 


***Caveat Lector! (Reader Beware!)***

With regards,
Warkruid.
